# Beyond Campus
Beyond Campus is an online real estate service that aims to give college students access to housing options that are inclusive to their demographic, close to their school, and attainable even in high-demand college markets. Despite non-discriminatory renter protection laws that are in place, many real estate services have properties listed by owners that avoid college renters. To solve this issue, Beyond Campus requires that every rental property listed be accessible to the college renter. Additionally, we verify that each prospective renter is a college student in order to reduce renter competition in high-demand markets. This two-way requirement creates a profitable market that suits both the renter and the property owner.

Beyond Campus was created by Kyle Ronayne and Hayden Garrett as a semester project for Web Application Programming at Grand Valley State University.
